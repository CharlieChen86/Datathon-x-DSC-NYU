distraught that neither student was best served by the traditional grading system, gauld started the hyde school, which operated under a different set of priorities than other schools. the school began with a focus on five words: courage, integrity, leadership, curiosity, and concern, and the cardinal principle that every individual was born with a unique potential that defines a destiny.

in 1968 jane hartley and laura neely, both mothers of developmentally disabled children, had a dream. their dream was not only for their children but also for all developmentally disabled individuals. their belief was that everyone, regardless of their disability, had the right and need to live with dignity and respect as productive members of society. this simple but profound thought remains the agencies guiding principal to this day.

the two mothers decided to open a small facility where adults with developmental disabilities could learn, work, and have fun in a friendly, homelike atmosphere. they recruited ruth smith, another like-minded mother of a daughter with down syndrome. ruth was a pioneer in developing new programs for special needs children in tulsa.

today, home of hope, inc. is an amazingly complex and far-reaching corporation providing services to people with developmental and other disabilities in northeastern oklahoma in a stunning assortment of options in employment, housing, and recreation. these counties include rogers, mayes, craig and ottawa.
